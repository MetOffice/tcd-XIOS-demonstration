vertical_stratify_pressure
--------------------------

This example demonstrates XIOS mixed frequency output. It takes a canned dataset of temperature and pressure on 39 model levels at one lat-lon point and outputs
the temperature and pressure fields at different frequencies. The original model level pressure and temperature data as well as the interpolated temperature data are written out to one netCDF file.
