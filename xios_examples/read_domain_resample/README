read_domain_resample
--------------------

This example reads in a sample NetCDF file of arbitrary data on a 5 x 5 rectilinear (structured) horizontal domain and resamples to a 4 x 4 rectilinear horizontal domain using bilinear interpolation. The original and resampled data as well as a diff between them are written to one output NetCDF file. The unit tests include two known failure test cases where the expected result is not produced.
