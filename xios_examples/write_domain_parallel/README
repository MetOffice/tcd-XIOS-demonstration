write_domain_parallel
---------------------

This example demonstrates XIOS parallel write of a decomposed domain to one output NetCDF file.
It sets up a 100 x 100 unstructured horizontal domain with 3 vertical levels and creates two fields with sample data. 
For file 1, data is written at hourly intervals for 10 timesteps and incremented by 0.2 units. For file 2 data is written at 2-hourly intervals for 5 timesteps and incremented by 0.5 units.

Unit tests include:

- Checking the output files exist and are named correctly.
- Checking that each file has the correct number of times (10,5)
- Checking that the average value of the field in level 1 and final 
  timestep matches what we expect based on the starting value, number 
  of timesteps and increment (2.8, 3.0)
