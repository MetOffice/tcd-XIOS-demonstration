# Contribution Guidelines for TCD XIOS Demonstration

For code contributions, please create your own Fork of this repository and
propose code via Pull Request, as detailed in 
[repositories guidance.](repositories.md)

All code contributions will require a code review prior to merging to `main`.

Pull Requests should test your code contributions with respect to several
versions of XIOS, and provide a report within the PR. All tests must pass
for merging to be allowed.
Please ensure that all new directories have an `__init__.py` so that they
are 'discovered' by Python's `unittest` and suitable tests of the contributed code.

Please provide a README (or amend an existing one if appropriate) that describes
the behaviour that is being demonstrated by the contribution.
